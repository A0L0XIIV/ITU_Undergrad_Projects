a)

Quadratic interpolants are more accurate because they can fit to data points better than the linear interpolation.

With linear interpolation P(12) = 100.1428

Quadratic with (21,50)
>> x = [7,14,21];
>> Y = [98,101,50];
>> polyfit(x,Y,2)

ans =

   -0.5510   12.0000   41.0000

P1(x) = -0.551x^2 + 12x + 41
P1(12) = 105.656

Quadratic with (0,100)
>> x = [0,7,14]
>> y = [100,98,101];
>> polyfit(x,y,2)

ans =

    0.0510   -0.6429  100.0000

P2(x) = 0.051x^2 - 0.6429x + 100
P2(12) = 99.5992


b)

plot(P1)

plot(P2)

The second function (P2) is much better than the first one. It fits more then the P1 function.
