No, there is not finite floating point system that represent infinite numbers. Finite systems cannot represent infinite integers or floats. When system represent infinite floating numebers, system has 2 opitions.One of the option is cutting the float, the other option is rounding the float. So the system cannot represent the exact value of float.

1.a)
f2(x0,h)=2 * cos( 2 * x0 + h / 2) * sin( h / 2 )

derivative of f2 = -2 * sin( h / 2 + x) * sin( h / 2)

1.b)
syms a;
i=1;

while h>=1
a(i) = ( sin(x+h) - sin(x) ) / h
h = h*10
i=i+1
end

2)
2x^2 + 4x - 12 --->  2x^2 = 3multiplications, 4x = 1 multiplications, +&- = 2additions&subractions --> total = 6 operations

(x+2) ---> 1 operation, 2x(x+2) ---> 2 operations, -12 ---> 1 operation

without nested evaluation 6 operations. With nested evaluation 2*n = 4 operations. Nested evaluation is simpler than normal one.


4.a)
x=x^2 + 3/16
x-x^2=3/16
x(1-x) = 3/16
x = 3/16 * 1/(1-x)
x= 3 / (16-16x)

x{k+1} = 3 / (16-16x{k})

second point
x=x^-2 + 3/16 (?)

x{k+1} = x{k}^-2 + 3/16

4.b)
g(x)' <= k    k<1
For convergence these 2 have to be true.

4.c)
Approximately 10
